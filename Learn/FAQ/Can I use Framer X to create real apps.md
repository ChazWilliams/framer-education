# Can I use Framer X to create real apps?

Short answer no—long answer, kinda. 

Like other design tools, Framer X provides as an environment for creative decision-making, where designers can experiment, iterative, and invent solutions to design problems. Framer X sets itself apart by the types of problems it can solve—ones that involve interaction, data or animation—and the means a designer can use to solve those problems, namely code, web technologies, and collections of reusable components.

However, while Framer X does bring together development and design in powerful ways, it remains primarily a *design* tool, optimised for design, rather than a tool for building production websites and applications. Other tools do exist—however the burden of exporting production code often involves constraints and compromises in compatibility, creative flexibility, or design experience; and those constraints are only useful if your project shares the same platform and code base that the tool uses, too. 

Put plainly, the problems faced by application developers—like security, browser integration, and authentication—are different than the problems faced by designers, and are better left to the professionals.

That said, you can get pretty close with Framer X. 

The experiences you create can be fully interactive and data-driven, allowing users to complete the same journeys and tasks that they would in the “real" app or website. Depending on how you design your project, your prototype can be as slick as any native application, virtually indistinguishable from the real thing. 

If you’re using code components, then the components you write may provide excellent starting points for your development process—either as skeletons on which to build, or as deep references that express both how the component should look as well as how it should *work*.

And the Web Previews that you export from Framer X are self-contained websites that can be permanently hosted online. Depending on the scale of your project, this might be enough, too.
